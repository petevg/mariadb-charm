While access to software components of an Evaluation Subscription are subject
to underlying applicable open source or proprietary license(s), as the case may
be (and this Evaluation Agreement does not limit or further restrict any open
  source license rights), access to any Services or non-open source software
  components is for the sole purpose of evaluating and testing
  (“Evaluation Purpose”) the suitability of a MariaDB Subscription for your own
  use for a defined time period and support level.

Your right to access an Evaluation Subscription without charge is conditioned on
 the following: (a) you agree to the MariaDB Enterprise Terms and Conditions
 (the “Subscription Agreement”);
(b) you agree that this Evaluation Subscription does not grant any right or
license, express or implied, for the use of any MariaDB or third party trade
names, service marks or trademarks, including, without limitation, the right to
distribute any software using any such marks; and (c) if you use our Services
for any purpose other than Evaluation Purposes, you agree to pay MariaDB
per-unit Subscription Fee(s) pursuant to the Subscription Agreement. Using our
Services in ways that do not constitute an Evaluation Purpose include (but are
  not limited to) using Services in connection with Production Purposes or third
   parties, or as a complement or supplement to third party support services.
   Capitalized terms not defined in this Evaluation Agreement shall have the
   meaning provided in the Subscription Agreement, which is incorporated by
   reference in its entirety.

By using any of our Services, you affirm that you have read, understood, and
agree to all of the terms and conditions of this Evaluation Agreement
(including the Subscription Agreement). If you are an individual acting on
behalf of an entity, you represent that you have the authority to enter into
this Evaluation Agreement on behalf of that entity. If you do not accept the
terms and conditions of this Evaluation Agreement, then you must not use any
of our Services.
