description: |
  MariaDB is an open source database server. It can be used as the backing
  database for web, business, and other applications and application servers.
  It is an evolution of the popular MySQL database, the M in the popular LAMP
  (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) web-based application server software stack.
  MariaDB offers enhanced performance, more features, and greater scalability
  while maintaining full transparent compatibility with the many existing
  applications built to work with MySQL. This charm downloads and deploys
  MariaDB on an Ubuntu system.
